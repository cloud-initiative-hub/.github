# Cloud Initiative

This project aims to empower and equip our internal developers with the skills and resources necessary to leverage the power of cloud technologies, specifically focusing on AWS.

## Key Objectives:

- Upskilling: Provide workshops, tutorials, and hands-on exercises to enhance developers' understanding and expertise in AWS services.
- Resource Library: Curate a comprehensive collection of documentation, code samples, and best practices to serve as a reference for developers building cloud-based applications.
- Community Building: Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among developers through workshops, forums, or internal knowledge-sharing sessions.
- Improved Efficiency: By facilitating the adoption of cloud technologies, the project aims to increase development agility and efficiency within the organization.

## Target Audience:

This project primarily targets internal developers who are new to cloud computing or want to expand their knowledge of AWS services. However, experienced developers can also benefit from the resources and best practices provided.

## Project Components:

- Workshops: Interactive sessions led by experienced instructors that cover key AWS concepts, services, and best practices.
- Resource Library: A centralized repository of documentation, tutorials, code samples, and architectural diagrams related to AWS development.
- Cloud Foundry (or similar name): A platform or environment provisioned specifically for experimentation and learning with AWS services. (Consider replacing "Cloud Foundry" with a chosen name from your brainstorming session)

## Getting Started:
